    "\n",
    "#### ![image](download8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Observations:\n",
    "Right-skewed distribution: The majority of customers have a lower CLV, with a smaller number of customers contributing significantly higher values. This is indicated by the elongated tail on the right side of the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concentration around lower CLV: The tallest bar is on the left side of the graph, suggesting a large portion of customers have a CLV within the lower range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers: There are some customers with exceptionally high CLV values, represented by the bars on the far right of the histogram. These customers contribute significantly to overall revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implications:\n",
    "Focus on customer retention: Since a large portion of customers have lower CLV, efforts to improve customer retention and increase purchase frequency can be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify high-value customers: The customers with exceptionally high CLV deserve special attention and tailored marketing strategies to maximize their value.\n",
