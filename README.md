## Methodologies
 
### Data Exploration:
 
 The database was first explored to see the tables embedded in it in the notebook, afterwhich each table was viewed on a different sql environment.
 
 The Join SQL was used to join most of the tables in the database that would be needed in exploring the project prompts, and this was then assigned to a dataframe
 
### Data Cleaning:

 The data types for each columns was examined, and the dates column (HireDate, BirthDate and InvoiceDate) on each tables were adjusted to the Datetime datatype.
 The column names from the dataframe were renamed to avoid duplication and confusions
 Duplicate data was checked and removed from the table
 
### Data Anaysis:

#### Top-sell Artist:

 The artist name, and revenue generated by year was collected from joinng appropriate tables.
 
#### Customer Purchase Pattern:
 To segment customers based on purchase behavior and identify key characteristics of high-value customers using the Chinook database, we can analyze customer purchase patterns by calculating total spending, number of purchases, and average purchase value. Then, we can identify key characteristics such as country, preferred genre, etc This was achieved by creating multiple temporary table: customer purchase pattern customer genre purchases and customer genre preferences.
 
#### Genre Popularity:
we explored the genre table on the chinook db. We join the invoice, tracks and the genre table for analysis
 
#### Sales Overtime:
Invoice table was queries to analysed sales overtime monthly and yearly.

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):
Calculate the lifetime value of customers based on their purchase history.
Customer table was analysed and the following information was filtered to get the following information:
FirstName, LastName, Country, State, TotalRevenue, AvgPurchaseValue and PurchaseFrequency

#### ![download8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/421af18d-3e0e-485a-9c72-e8715e425398)


Key Observations:
Right-skewed distribution: The majority of customers have a lower CLV, with a smaller number of customers contributing significantly higher values. This is indicated by the elongated tail on the right side of the histogram.

Concentration around lower CLV: The tallest bar is on the left side of the graph, suggesting a large portion of customers have a CLV within the lower range.

Outliers: There are some customers with exceptionally high CLV values, represented by the bars on the far right of the histogram. These customers contribute significantly to overall revenue.

Implications:
Focus on customer retention: Since a large portion of customers have lower CLV, efforts to improve customer retention and increase purchase frequency can be beneficial.

Identify high-value customers: The customers with exceptionally high CLV deserve special attention and tailored marketing strategies to maximize their value.

Customer segmentation: Dividing customers into segments based on CLV can help in targeted marketing and resource allocation.

#### Czech Republic and USA:
These countries have a higher median CLV compared to other countries. Additionally, they have a wider range of CLV values, indicating greater variation in customer spending habits.

#### Lower CLV Countries: 
Countries like Brazil, Portugal, and Canada have lower median CLV values and a narrower range, suggesting a more homogenous customer base with lower spending.

#### Outliers:
While present in multiple countries, some countries like the USA and Czech Republic have more pronounced outliers, indicating the presence of high-value customers

#### Recommendation:

Market Segmentation: Focus on understanding the factors contributing to higher CLV in countries like Czech Republic and the USA to replicate success in other markets.

Customer Retention: Implement targeted retention strategies for countries with lower CLV to increase customer lifetime value.
